### Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Exploratory Data Analysis

This inolves exploring amd manipulation of data to answer some questions

### Data Analydsis

This has to do with the several functions or line of codes (queries) used during the Analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SALARY]
where STAFF_ID = 'AB503'
```
